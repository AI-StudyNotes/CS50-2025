## [Question 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/quizzes/1/#question-2)

**There are other logical connectives that exist, other than the ones discussed in lecture. One of the most common is “Exclusive Or” (represented using the symbol ⊕). The expression `A ⊕ B` represents the sentence “A or B, but not both.” Which of the following is logically equivalent to `A ⊕ B`?**

- `(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∧ B)`
- `(A ∧ B) ∨ ¬ (A ∨ B)`
- `(A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∧ B)`
- `(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∨ B)`

- ∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∃y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
- ∀x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∀y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
- ∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∨ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
